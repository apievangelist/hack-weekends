<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is side project of mine, to help me understand how to manage my world in a more open and transparent way.</p>
<p>I want everything I do to be machine readable, and open by default.  Github is the perfect platform for this.</p>
<p>The idea behind this site is to give me a platform for managing all of my blog and page content as well as data in a friction-less way.</p>
<p>I can manage static pages and blog posts using prose.io.</p>
<p>I can manage JSON files using an online <a href="http://jsoneditoronline.org/" target="_blank">JSON editor</a>.</p>
<p>But I needed a way to allow the creation of JSON files from common tools, so I'm creating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paste CSV</li>
<li>Upload CSV</li>
<li>Google Spreadsheet URL</li>
</ul>
<p>This will allow anyone to easily publish JSON data derived from things we do every day, easily exposing data, not necessary as APIs, but machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Next using Mustache templating and tools like Google Charts I will make snippets that will allow me to display meaningful content derived from JSON datasets in pages and blog posts.</p>
<p>My hope is to create a platform that will run on Github, Amazon S3 and Dropbox that will allow easy content and data management in the most open way possible.</p>
