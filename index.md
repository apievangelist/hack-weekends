<h1>Working Site</h1>
<p>This is a sample website built with Jekyll + Mustache, hosted on Github.</p>
<p>It is meant to be a very simple, entirely client-side blog, site and data management tool.</p>
<p>Right now it has 3 main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages (<a href="index">Home</a>, <a href="about">About</a>, <a href="blog">Blog</a>)</li>
<li><a href="blog">Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="directory">Directory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a work in progress, so more to come...</p>
