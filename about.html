<h1>About Hack Weekends</h1>

<p>This site is intended to provide all the necessary resources for organizing and publizing hackathons. This entire site is <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends/tree/gh-pages">hosted on Github as an open source repository</a>. I needed a way to share the information available on Hack Weekends, while sharing the responsibility of maintaining with the community.</p>

<p>To deploy this site I used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Github Pages</li>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>JSON Data Stores</li>
    <li>Mustache Templates</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted an easy way to host pages and the blog for Hack Weekends.  Github Pages + Jekyll does this, allowing me to edit these static pages using prose.io.</p>
<p>In addition to pages and blog posts I wanted to share dynamic data like the hackathon events calendar, organizers, venues and much more.  JSON files + Mustache templates will handle this.</p>
<p>Here are the hackathon data resources I intend to publish on Hack Weekends:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hackathons</li>
    <li>Organizers</li>
    <li>Sponsors</li>
    <li>Venues</li>
    <li>Vendors</li>
    <li>Tools</li>
    <li>Speakers</li>
    <li>PR Opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>These hackathon resources are available via JSON files, and browsing via the Hack Weekends site. The goal is to provide open marketplace for hackathons to occur, running it as an open source project.</p>
