Sharing API calls between your server side and the client\u2019s browser is actually critical to making some Twitter integrations work and there\u2019s a great tip on how to use server side caching: \n  You can call the API from the browser, display the results, and then call your server with the data you got from the API.  In effect you are using all of the user browsers as a large collection grid.  This approach can be used to reduce the amount of API calls you have to do from the server.  This type of technique highlights how important it is for API Providers to map out the use cases they aim to support with their APIs \u2013 since rate limits can typically completely handicap some usage scenarios \u2013 in particular for APIS which have server-side and end-user scenarios.","item_date":"Jul 11 2012 07:00:00","display_item_date":"07-11-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.3scale.net\/2012\/07\/api-rate-limit-kung-fu-the-server-side\/","source":"www.3scale.net","tags":"3Scale"},{"title":"Decibel Chooses 3scale SaaS API Management Solution to Distribute Semantic Music Metadata APIs to Broadcasting, Media and Digital Companies","details":"  SAN FRANCISCO, CA\u2013July 9, 2012\u2013 Decibel, the \u2018semantic music metadata company and reportedly the fastest growing European company in the digital music sector, selected 3scale (www.  3scale.  net), the creator of Out-of-the-Box API management infrastructure, to launch, manage and productize Decibel APIs.

When looking at a technology phenomenon like APIs, the application programming interfaces that allow direct access to resources so that applications can be built, it is easy to ignore the larger forest of the business practices instead focus on the technology trees.  But, by taking a step back and looking at not just the technology mechanisms of APIs, but also the patterns they have created for meeting modern business challenges, it is possible to take a massive leap forward.  In this article I will argue that there is a huge opportunity for large companies to adopt APIs not just as a way of programming but as a new paradigm for accelerating achievement of a variety of business goals.  By creating its own API economy, a large company like AT&T can both provide remedies to common problems facing large organizations and at the same time open up and accelerate innovation and product development.","item_date":"Jun 22 2012 22:31:01","display_item_date":"06-22-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/danwoods\/2012\/06\/21\/how-att-adopted-apis-as-an-innovation-paradigm\/?goback=.gde_2637634_member_126769582","source":"www.forbes.com","tags":"AT&T"},{"title":"The Amazon API battle for the cloud rages on","details":"  The battle over whether it\u2019s productive for cloud providers to clone Amazon\u2019s APIs will rage on this week.

Comprehensive reform, once agreed to and implemented in full, will have far-reaching implications for the global financial system and the world economy.  In a new book, Building a More Resilient Financial Sector, edited by Aditya Narain, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, and myself, we summarize our views on various reform proposals discussed since 2008, ranging from various regulatory reforms to supervision, too-important-to-fail (TITF) proposals, restricting banks\u2019 size and scope, resolution, and to living wills.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF), alongside the Bank for International Settlements and Financial Stability Board, has been at the forefront of discussions on shaping the new financial system to reduce the possibility of future crises and limit the consequences if they occur.  Current reforms are moving in the right direction towards building a more resilient financial system capable of supporting sustainable economic growth, but many policy choices\u2014both urgent and challenging\u2014still lie ahead.","item_date":"May 10 2012 07:00:00","display_item_date":"05-10-2012","url":"http:\/\/blogs.worldbank.org\/allaboutfinance\/node\/731","source":"blogs.worldbank.org","tags":"Banks, finan, Financial, Markets, Voice"},{"title":"AWS re: Invent - Global Customer and Partner Conference","details":"  Block off November 27-29 on your calendar, book a flight to Las Vegas, and plan to spend three days at AWS re: Invent learning more about AWS from AWS engineers, architects, partners, and customers in over 100 sessions.
