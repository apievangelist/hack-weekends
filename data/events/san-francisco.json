Of growing concern, is the donation of homemade toys, and whether or not Toys for Tots will continue to accept such toys, even though they may not have undergone the new testing process required for toys. The Foundation is taking the position that since homemade toymakers are not producing toys for the purposes of making a profit and have no reason to cut corners to increase profit margins or reduce their inventory, and that the toys are generally safe with minimal moving parts that could cause injury, that we will continue to accept homemade toys.  In doing so, there are three layers of safety that must be in place to ensure this policy can continue.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Layer One:<\/strong> Toy makers must understand the requirement that homemade toys be safe (no small parts; rounded edges; lead-free paint; etc.); <\/li>\n<li><strong>Layer Two:<\/strong> Toys for Tots coordinators (and their volunteer assistants) must take steps to ensure the makers are informed of the Layer One requirement, carefully inspect homemade toys when they are donated, AND make every effort to distribute such toys appropriately; and<\/li>\n<li><strong>Layer <\/strong><strong>Three<\/strong>: Parents must ensure that any toy given to them to, in turn, present to their child, must be age appropriate.\" [Guidelines from: Toys for Tots]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Toy or Item Drop-Off?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you only have time to drop-off a toy or gift, feel free to stop by and drop off items. If you plan to stay for longer, we will ask you to purchase a ticket so that we can manage our capacity.
